# Roadmap

This document outlines GitStore's product strategy, architectural decisions, and technology roadmap. It is organised into strategic decisions, product phase roadmap, technology evaluation, and operational requirements.

## Strategic Decisions

### Platform Shape (Core vs Optional)

- **Core GitStore runtime (required):** `git-server` and `api` only.
- **Optional capability modules:** recommendations, OIDC, user management, and other integrations are deployable add-ons.
- **Local-first adoption principle:** a single bootstrap script should run GitStore locally with zero heavy infrastructure requirements.
- **In-memory first defaults:** use in-memory storage/cache for local development by default.
- **Production-ready upgrades (optional):** external infrastructure like ScyllaDB for datastore, Valkey for cache, Qdrant for vector search, and external identity services can be enabled incrementally.

#### Optional Modules and Dependencies

- **Recommendation module:** requires an optional vector database (for example Qdrant or Typesense vector capabilities).
- **OIDC module:** requires an optional OIDC service deployment.
- **User management module:** requires an optional identity/user-management service deployment.
- **Caching module:** optional Redis or Valkey, with in-memory fallback.
- **Order management persistence acceleration:** optional distributed stores for high-scale deployments, with in-memory fallback.

### Identity & Authentication Architecture

#### OIDC and User Management (OSS Options)

- **Ory Hydra (OIDC/OAuth2 engine):** standards-focused OIDC/OAuth2 server that intentionally decouples protocol from user management.
- **Dex (OIDC federation engine):** OIDC provider with connector-based federation to LDAP, SAML, OIDC, GitHub, and others.
- **Keycloak (integrated IAM option):** full IAM suite with OIDC, SAML, user federation, admin UI, and built-in user management.

#### Headless User Management (OSS Options)

- **Ory Kratos:** headless identity and user-management APIs for registration, login, account recovery, MFA, and profile lifecycle.
- **ZITADEL (OSS self-hostable):** IAM platform with user and organisation management, OIDC/OAuth2/SAML support.
- **SuperTokens (OSS core):** modular auth stack for sign-in, sessions, and user account management with self-hosting support.

#### Recommended Pairings for GitStore

- **Hydra + Kratos:** strict separation of OIDC protocol and user lifecycle, aligned with decoupled architecture.
- **Dex + existing enterprise IdP/LDAP:** best when customers already have identity providers and need federation quickly.
- **Keycloak only:** fastest single-service path when operational simplicity is preferred over service separation.

## Product Roadmap

### Phase 0: Core Git-Backed Catalogue

Git-backed product catalogue with flexible configuration and data interchange formats.

- **Improvement to Catalogue Frontmatter**: Kubernetes-style frontmatter for better configuration management and flexibility. `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec` fields will be added to product, category, and collection files to enhance organisation and maintainability.
  - Create a controller per the core object type (Product, Category, Collection) that reconciles desired state.
  - **Operators**: Custom controllers + CRD will enable extensibility for new catalogue types and behaviours without modifying the core GitStore runtime.
- **References in catalogue files**: Enable references in catalogue files to allow for more flexible and maintainable product, category, and collection definitions.
- **Expressions in Product Files**: Allow merchants to use expressions in product files for dynamic pricing, inventory management, and other use cases.

### Phase 1: Adoption Friction & Local Development

Minimise barriers to local startup and experimentation.

- **Local Bootstrap Script with In-Memory Defaults** (Initiative #43): Single command startup with zero infrastructure dependencies; optional external service flags for external deployments.
- **Basic Inventory Management**: Develop an inventory management system that allows merchants to easily track and manage their stock levels.

### Phase 2: Commerce Core

Essential e-commerce operations: shopping carts, transactions, order lifecycle, and customer profiles.

- **Basket Management**: Implement a robust basket management system that allows users to easily add, remove, and update items in their shopping cart.
- **Checkout Process**: Develop a seamless checkout process that integrates with various payment gateways and provides a smooth user experience.
- **Order Tracking**: Enable users to track their orders in real-time, providing updates on the status of their shipments and estimated delivery times.
- **User Profiles** (Initiative #28): Create user profiles that allow customers to manage their personal information, view order history, and save their preferences. Integrates with OIDC and user-management services.

### Phase 3: Advanced & Extensibility

Platform ecosystem, AI-driven features, and deep customisation.

- **Settings**: Implement a settings management system that allows merchants to configure various aspects of their store, such as payment options, shipping methods, tax rules, and more. This will provide merchants with greater control over their store's operations and enable them to tailor the shopping experience to their specific needs.
  - Explore kubernetes-style ConfigMaps and Secrets for settings management, allowing for flexible and secure configuration of store settings through Git.
- **Enterprise SSO Support** (Initiative #47): Add enterprise single sign-on support through standards-based OIDC and SAML federation so organisations can use their existing identity providers. Include role and group claim mapping into GitStore authorisation scopes.
- **SCIM Provisioning** (Initiative #48): Add SCIM 2.0 user and group provisioning endpoints to automate enterprise identity lifecycle events (create, update, disable, and group sync) from external IdPs.
- **Fine-Grained Authorisation** (Initiative #50): Add an optional authorisation module powered by OpenFGA or SpiceDB for relationship-based access control and tenant-safe policy enforcement without changing core-mode defaults.
  - Declarative authorisation (Markdown via Git) policies similar to Kubernetes RBAC, with support for users, groups, roles, and permissions.
- **Product Recommendations**: Implement a recommendation engine that suggests products based on user behaviour and preferences. Requires vector database and recommendation module.
- **App Marketplace**: Create an app marketplace where third-party developers can create and sell extensions and integrations for our platform.
  - **ERP Connectors**: Develop connectors for popular ERP systems to allow merchants to easily integrate their existing systems with our platform. Inventory management, order processing, and customer data synchronisation will be key features of these connectors.
  - **CMS Connectors**: Create connectors for popular CMS platforms to enable seamless content management and integration with our ecommerce platform.
- **Agent Marketplace**: Develop an agent marketplace where users can create and share AI agents that automate various tasks within the ecommerce platform.
  - **a2a protocol**: Define and implement an agent-to-agent communication protocol that allows agents to interact and collaborate effectively. AgentCard skills and capabilities will be designed to be easily discoverable and usable by other agents in the marketplace.
- **Extension Marketplace**: Create WASI-based extensions that can be easily integrated into the platform to override or enhance existing functionality. These extensions will be designed to override or enhance critical parts of the platform, such as the checkout process, recommendation engine, asset/image management, and more, allowing for a high degree of customisation and flexibility for merchants.
  - Compare using WASM over OCI for extensions - pros and cons of each approach, potential use cases, and implementation considerations.
- **Agents for the Buyer Journey**: Create AI agents that assist customers throughout their shopping experience, from product discovery to post-purchase support. These agents will provide personalised recommendations, answer customer inquiries, and help with order management.
  - **MCP Apps**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) apps will be developed to enable agents to access and utilise contextual information about products, user preferences, and shopping behaviour to provide more relevant and personalised assistance to customers.
  - **ACP and UCP**: Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) and Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) will be designed to enable entire shopping journeys and checkout flows to be executed by agents, providing a seamless and automated shopping experience for customers.
- **Query Language**: Develop a powerful and flexible query language that allows users to easily retrieve and manipulate data within the platform. This will enable merchants and developers to create custom reports, dashboards, and integrations with ease.
- **CI/CD**: Implement _GitStore Actions_, a CI/CD pipeline with a workflow canvas for designing the build, test, and deployment processes of product catalogues.
- **Namespaces**: Introduce namespaces to allow for better organisation by userspace, organisation (storefront) or enterprise (tenant). This will enable multiple teams or departments to manage their own catalogues and configurations within the same platform without conflicts.
  - Similar to Kubernetes namespaces using declarative Markdown files in Git.
- **Custom Workflow**: Allow merchants and 3rd party developers to create custom workflows that can be triggered by specific events or conditions within the platform. This will enable a high degree of automation and customisation for merchants, allowing them to tailor the platform to their specific needs and use cases. This is especially powerful when combined with new product types defined by extensions, allowing for custom lifecycle management and orchestration of products, orders, inventory, and more.

## Technology Exploration

Open questions and technologies under evaluation for future phases.

- **Xet**: Alternative to Git LFS?
- **Parquet**: Explore the use cases?
- **mmap and io_uring**: Efficient storage and retrieval?
- **RocksDB or DuckDB**: Embedded databases for catalogue management?
- **Redis or Valkey**: KV store for caching and fast access?
- **Qdrant or Typesense**: Vector search for product recommendations and search?
- **ScyllaDB or Cassandra**: Distributed databases for scalability and high availability?
- **[Memdb](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-memdb)**: In-memory database for fast access and caching?

- **Declarative**: Everything in Kubernetes is declarative, the controller eventually converges the actual state to the desired state. 
  GitStore could adopt a similar approach where the desired state of the product catalogue is defined in Git, and the GitStore runtime ensures 
  that the actual state of the catalogue matches the desired state. This would allow for better version control, collaboration, and rollback 
  capabilities for merchants managing their product catalogues. The catalogue types:
  - Product
  - Category
  - Collection
  - Inventory
  - File
    - type: gitstore.dev/media
  - [Access Control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/)
  - Role
  - ServiceAccount
  - Storage
    - volume: PersistentVolume / CSI
  - Namespace
    - type: Enterprise(tenant), Organisation(storefront)

- Favour CLI over Admin UI. Admin UI is a nice-to-have for user-friendly management, but the CLI should be the primary interface for managing the platform, 
  especially for developers and AI agents. The CLI will provide a more powerful and flexible way to interact with the platform, allowing for automation and 
  integration with other tools and workflows. The Admin UI can be built on top of the GraphQL API to provide a user-friendly interface for non-technical users,
  but it should not be the only way to manage the platform.
  > Vendors can build their own Admin UIs similar to Rancher for Kubernetes.

## Operational

### Sandbox Environment

- Deploy to https://sandbox.gitstore.dev
- Disable authentication for easy access and testing
- Disable mutations to prevent data loss and ensure a stable testing environment
  - If mutation is not disabled, implement a reset mechanism to restore the sandbox to a known state after testing.
  - Add a notification banner to inform users that they are in a sandbox environment and that data may be reset periodically.

### Coverage

- Setup codecov, GitHub CI script already in place, but needs to be enabled and configured.
- Add codecov badges to README and documentation
