# Tasks: GitStore - Git-Backed Ecommerce Engine

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-git-backed-ecommerce/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Test-First Development (Constitution Principle I - NON-NEGOTIABLE). Tests MUST be written before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Multi-service architecture:
- **Git Server**: `git-server/src/`, `git-server/tests/`
- **API**: `api/internal/`, `api/cmd/`, `api/tests/`
- **Admin UI**: `admin-ui/src/`, `admin-ui/tests/`
- **Shared**: `shared/schemas/`
- **Docker**: `docker/`, `compose.yml`

---

## Phase 7: Bug Fixes & Investigation (Added 2026-03-22)

**Purpose**: Address issues discovered during manual testing with Docker compose setup

**Context**: Following scripts/README.md instructions, two critical issues were identified:
1. GraphQL API returns "repository does not exist" error when querying products
2. Websocket notifications not firing when creating git tags in Docker environment

### Investigation Tasks - Repository Not Found

- [X] T145 [CRITICAL] Investigate "repository does not exist" error in GraphQL API
  - **Location**: api/internal/gitclient/ or api/internal/cache/
  - **Symptoms**: GraphQL query fails with "failed to get products: failed to get catalog: failed to open repository: repository does not exist"
  - **Test Query**: `query { products { edges { node { id sku title } } } }`
  - **Environment**: Docker compose with GITSTORE_DATA_DIR volume mount
  - **Root Cause Found**: Architecture mismatch - API received git:// URL but used git.PlainOpen() expecting local path, plus missing volume mount
  - **Investigation Report**: specs/001-git-backed-ecommerce/T145-INVESTIGATION.md
  - **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Quick fix applied (shared volume)

- [X] T146 [CRITICAL] Fix repository initialization in Docker environment
  - **Depends on**: T145 investigation findings
  - **Solution Applied**: Option 2 (Shared Volume) quick fix
    - [X] Added volume mount to API service in compose.yml
    - [X] Changed GITSTORE_GIT_REPO from git:// URL to local path
    - [X] API now has read-only access to /data/repos
  - **Testing**: ✅ All pass conditions met (QUICK-TEST.md)
  - **Status**: ✅ QUICK FIX COMPLETE
  - **Future**: T152 will implement proper git protocol solution (Option 1)

### Investigation Tasks - Websocket Notifications

- [X] T147 [CRITICAL] Investigate websocket notification failure on tag creation
  - **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
  - **Root Causes Found**:
    1. README workflow out of order (services not started before clone)
    2. Filesystem clone used instead of HTTP clone (bypassed git-server)
    3. Git binary missing from git-server Docker image
    4. Websocket message format mismatch (fixed to use GitEvent structure)
  - **Fixes Applied**: All issues resolved, websocket notifications working end-to-end

- [X] T148 [CRITICAL] Fix tag event detection and validation issues
  - **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
  - **Issues Fixed**:
    1. Init script missing required `product_ids` field in collections (added `product_ids: []`)
    2. Websocket message format corrected to use `GitEvent::release_created()`
    3. README.md and init script documentation updated with correct workflow
  - **Remaining**: Validation error messages still use Rust debug format (see T153)

- [X] T153 [MEDIUM] Improve git validation error message formatting
  - **Location**: git-server/src/http_git_server.rs:264-267
  - **Issue**: Currently returns Rust debug format to git client
  - **Current**:
    ```
    error: RPC failed; HTTP 422 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 422
    send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
    ```
  - **Should return** (GitHub-style):
    ```
    remote: ========================================
    remote: GitStore Catalog Validation Failed
    remote: ========================================
    remote:
    remote: File: products/prod_book_001.md
    remote:   - Invalid currency code: XYZ
    remote:   - Price must be >= 0
    remote:
    ! [remote rejected] main -> main (validation failed)
    ```
  - **Implementation**: Create `format_validation_errors_for_git()` helper function
  - **Priority**: Not blocking MVP, improves UX

- [X] T149 [P] Add websocket notification health check
  - **Location**: git-server/src/websocket/server.rs and api/cmd/server/main.go
  - **Purpose**: Verify websocket connectivity at startup
  - **Implementation**:
    - [ ] API logs websocket connection status on startup
    - [ ] Git-server logs active websocket connections
    - [ ] Add /websocket/health endpoint to git-server
    - [ ] API retries websocket connection on failure with backoff

### Integration Testing

- [X] T150 [P] Create end-to-end Docker compose test script
  - **Location**: tests/e2e/docker-test.sh
  - **Purpose**: Automated testing of Docker deployment workflow
  - **Steps**:
    1. Run scripts/init-demo-catalog.sh
    2. Start docker compose
    3. Wait for health checks
    4. Create git tag v1.0.0
    5. Query GraphQL API for products
    6. Verify products returned
    7. Verify API logs show websocket notification received
  - **Expected**: End-to-end workflow completes successfully

- [X] T151 [P] Document Docker deployment troubleshooting
  - **Location**: docs/docker-troubleshooting.md or README.md section
  - **Content**:
    - [ ] Repository initialization checklist
    - [ ] Websocket connectivity verification steps
    - [ ] Volume mount path debugging
    - [ ] Common error messages and solutions
    - [ ] Log locations for each service

- [ ] T152 [P] Implement proper git protocol solution for catalog queries
  - **Purpose**: Replace shared volume quick fix with production-ready git protocol (like GitLab/Gitea)
  - **Location**: api/internal/catalog/loader.go
  - **Current Issue**: API reads from shared volume `/data/repos/` (tight coupling, can't scale)
  - **Changes**:
    - [ ] Detect if repoPath is git:// URL or local path
    - [ ] Implement git.Clone() for remote URLs
    - [ ] Cache cloned repository in temporary directory
    - [ ] Implement pull/update logic for repository refresh
    - [ ] Support both remote and local repository modes
  - **Benefits**: True microservices, remote git-server support, better scalability
  - **Testing**: Verify both git:// and /data/repos/ paths work
  - **Priority**: DEFERRED - Quick fix (T146) sufficient for MVP
  - **Documentation**: See T152-PROPER-GIT-PROTOCOL.md for detailed implementation plan

- [ ] T154 [MEDIUM] Use temporary clones for API mutations (GitLab/Gitea pattern)
  - **Purpose**: API should not maintain persistent working copy for mutations
  - **Current Issue**: API has persistent working directory (if implemented) - wrong architecture
  - **Location**: api/internal/gitclient/ mutation handlers
  - **Correct Pattern** (how GitLab/Gitea work):
    ```go
    func (s *MutationResolver) UpdateProduct(...) {
        // 1. Create temp directory
        tmpDir, _ := os.MkdirTemp("", "gitstore-*")
        defer os.RemoveAll(tmpDir)  // Auto-cleanup

        // 2. Clone from git-server
        git.PlainClone(tmpDir, false, &git.CloneOptions{
            URL: "git://git-server:9418/catalog.git",
        })

        // 3. Modify files in temp clone
        writeProductFile(tmpDir, product)

        // 4. Commit and push
        repo.Worktree().Commit("Update product", ...)
        repo.Push(...)

        // 5. Temp clone deleted automatically
    }
    ```
  - **Benefits**:
    - No persistent state in API (stateless, scalable)
    - Each mutation isolated (no file conflicts)
    - Matches industry standard (GitLab, Gitea, GitHub)
  - **Testing**: Verify mutations still work, check temp dirs cleaned up
  - **Priority**: DEFERRED - Current approach works for MVP, refactor for production

## MVP Scope Clarification (Updated 2026-03-22)

**Out of Scope for MVP** (Deferred to post-launch):
- ❌ Image URL validation and CDN integration (FR-020 partial - basic URL format check sufficient)
- ❌ AI agent validation testing (SC-006 - aspirational metric, not blocking)
- ❌ Advanced metrics and monitoring (T136 - Prometheus exporters)
- ❌ Accessibility enhancements (T137 - ARIA labels)
- ❌ Rate limiting (T134 - not needed for initial deployment scale)

**In Scope for MVP** (Must Complete):
- ✅ User Stories 1, 2, 3 (P1, P2, P3)
- ✅ Repository initialization and catalog loading (T145-T146 fixes)
- ✅ Websocket notifications (T147-T148 fixes)
- ✅ GraphQL filtering (T127 - required for storefront queries)
- ✅ Basic documentation (T140-T142)
- ✅ Health checks (T135 - already complete)
- ✅ Demo catalog initialization (T131 - already complete)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on US1 (can develop in parallel)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 and US2 mutations but can stub for testing

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (Test-First) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Git server components before API (API depends on git server running)
- API mutations before Admin UI (UI calls API)
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Within a story, models/validators marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (Test-First):
Task: "Write contract test for products query in api/tests/contract/products_test.go" [T025]
Task: "Write contract test for product(by: {sku}) query in api/tests/contract/product_test.go" [T026]
Task: "Write integration test for git push validation in git-server/tests/integration/push_validation_test.rs" [T027]

# After tests are written and failing, launch parallel implementations:
Task: "Implement git repository initialization in git-server/src/git/repo.rs" [T030]
Task: "Implement pre-receive hook handler in git-server/src/git/hooks.rs" [T031]
Task: "Implement websocket server setup in git-server/src/websocket/server.rs" [T035]
Task: "Implement git repository reader in api/internal/gitclient/reader.go" [T040]
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently (git push → storefront query)
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (categories/collections)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (admin UI)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer/Team A: User Story 1 (git server + API queries)
   - Developer/Team B: User Story 2 (categories/collections)
   - Developer/Team C: User Story 3 (admin UI)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (Test-First Development - Constitution Principle I)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Test-First is NON-NEGOTIABLE per Constitution - all tests written before implementation
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
